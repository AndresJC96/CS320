# CS320

One thing I have learned from these projects is that keeping my code functional and secure starts with validating everything and testing every rule the program is supposed to follow. Writing both positive and negative tests helped me catch mistakes early and made me more confident in the behavior of my classes and services. When something failed, the tests showed me exactly where the issue was and why. This process made me think more like a tester and reminded me that good software depends on catching problems before they grow into something bigger. I realized that small habits like checking for null values, enforcing length limits, and using clear error messages go a long way toward building secure and reliable programs.

Interpreting user needs means slowing down and really understanding what the requirements are asking for, then translating those details into code and tests that reflect them. Whenever the instructions said what a field should look like or what behavior was expected, I made sure there was a test that proved the program actually did what the user needed. This shaped how I approached designing software overall. I try to build things in small pieces, keep the structure clean, and focus on clarity so the logic is easy to follow and update. Writing tests alongside the code kept me grounded in what the user needed and helped me design programs that are not only correct but easier to grow and maintain in the future.
